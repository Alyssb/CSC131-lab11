# Lab 11

## Introduction

In this lab we'll work with creating a menu driven system and some objects.

## Tasks

Clone this repository and create a `develop` branch within which to do your work. After completing each of the following tasks, commit your changes with an appropriate commit message. Before you leave lab, be sure to push your commits to GitHub so you can create a pull request to submit on Blackboard.

1. Update the header comments; removing the TODO comment while you're at it.
1. Follow along with your instructor to get started.

## Submission Details

The usual assignment protocol is followed:

1. Accept this assignment using the URL found in the Blackboard assignment which creates your repository in your GitHub account.
1. Clone your repository and create a branch named develop within which to do your work.
1. Implement the code indicated by the `// TODO:` comments.
1. Minimally make commits after finishing each function; more commits are encouraged but not required.
1. Once the program behaves as prescribed, push your final commit to GitHub and create a pull request, requesting to merge your develop branch into your master branch.
1. After the pull request is created, copy the URL of the pull request and paste it into a Text Submission on Blackboard. You should make the URL a working hyperlink that opens the pull request in a new browser window. NOTE: The assignment is officially submitted by the act of creating and submitting this Blackboard Text Submission and it is the timestamp of that activity that dictates when your assignment was actually submitted.
